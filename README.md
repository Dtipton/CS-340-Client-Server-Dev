How do you write programs that are maintainable, readable, and adaptable? Especially consider your work on the CRUD Python module from Project One, which you used to connect the dashboard widgets to the database in Project Two. What were the advantages of working in this way? How else could you use this CRUD Python module in the future?

I write programs that adhere to the above by using clean and secure code. Making sure to make it easy to read and run by keeping recursion to a minimal and using readable variables and self explaiing code, and when that can't be the case make good use of comments. I make it adaptable by making the functions/ methods/classes I write as modular as possible so they can be used in many places.


How do you approach a problem as a computer scientist? Consider how you approached the database or dashboard requirements that Grazioso Salvare requested. How did your approach to this project differ from previous assignments in other courses? What techniques or strategies would you use in the future to create databases to meet other client requests?

I approach problems by listing out the requirements and trying to break down the problems into smaller chunks, essentially "stories" from an agile perspective. Doing this project differed from other projects in quite a few ways. I've never delt with a mongodb database before along with the dash framework. Getting use to the different db commands used in it compared to standard SQL was the biggest change.


What do computer scientists do, and why does it matter? How would your work on this type of project help a company, like Grazioso Salvare, to do their work better?

Computer Scientist solve real world problems by using the language of pcs to solve it. My work on this project would help a company be able to access, update, read, and delete entries in a mongodb database. This could easily be expanded on to do more with the database and could even be hooked up to different types of frontends / backends of websites / applications.
